# argvparse
A tiny C++ library for easier parsing of command line arguments

# Install

For compiling this library, a C++17 compatible compiler is required. The library also uses standard library components, so if you don't like that feel free to submit a pull request with custom 'unordered_map', 'vector' and 'std::for_each' implementations.
